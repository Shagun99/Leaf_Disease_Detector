# Leaf_Disease_Detector

Diseases in plants cause major production and economic losses as well as reduction in both quality and quantity of agricultural products. Nowadays plant diseases detection has received increasing attention in monitoring large field of crops. Farmers experience great difficulties in switching from one disease control policy to another. The naked eye observation of experts is the traditional approach adopted in practice for detection and identification of plant diseases. This simple plant leaf disease detector application would facilitate advancements in agriculture. Early information on crop health and disease detection can facilitate the control of diseases through proper management strategies. This will help improve and increase the productivity of crops.
